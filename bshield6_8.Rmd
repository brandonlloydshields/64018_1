# Question 1

# Amount over employment goal = -6y1p
# Amount under employment goall = -6y1m

# Amount over earnings goal = 0y2p
# Amount under earnings goal = -3y2m

# where y1p; y1m; y2p; y2m >= 0

# Product 1 = x1
# Product 2 = x2
# Product 3 = x3

# P = 20x1 + 15x2 + 25x3

# 6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - 50 = (y1p - y1m)
# 6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - y1p + y1m = 50

# 8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 - 75 = (y2p - y2m)
# 8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 - y2p + y2m = 75

#Question 2

# Max Z: 20x1 + 15x2 + 25x3 - 6y1p - 6y1m - 3y2m + 0y2p;
