## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)

x <- read.lp("bshield6_6.lp")

solve(x)
get.objective(x)
get.variables(x)

#The output suggests that Plant A should produce 100 AEDs and ship 0 to warehouse 1, 60 to warehouse 2 and 40 to warehouse 3. Plant B will produce 110 AEDs and send 80 to warehouse 1, 0 to warehouse 2 and 30 to warehouse 3.
